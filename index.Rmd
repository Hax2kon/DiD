# Overview
[**Introduction**](intro.html) introduces the DiD-estimator with the most basic canonical case, and then explains how more complex scenarios breaks the logic of the estimator.

[**Problems**](problems.html) list articles that identify problems with the standard TWFE and DiD-estimator, and ways to diagnose for those problems


[**Solutions**](solutions.html) gives a summary of articles that offer solutions to the [**Problems**](problems.html)


[**Definitions**](definitions.html) is a list of definitions for common concepts in the literature


# tldr; Just give me the answer
Many of the contributions talk about and deal with the same problem(s), and the main problem is that TWFE/standard DiD-estimator _potentially_ uses previously treated units as control-group units for other treated units. This is only a problem when units receive treatment at different points in time, and the effect of the treatment is heterogeneous. All solutions cost power.

For applied researchers, 2 contributions cover what you need:

**Diagnostics:** [**Goodman-Bacon 2018**](problems.html) offers solutions to identify whether there is a problem in your TWFE model. Out-of-the-box code in `R` and `Stata`.

**Solution:** [**Imai, Kim and Wang 2021**](solutions.html) offers a flexible solution which also incorporates matching for time-series cross-sectional data to establish parallel trends (balance on observable confounders). Out-of-the-box code in `R`.


It remains a problem that the vast majority of articles only deal with binary treatment effects (but see [**Callaway, Goodman–Bacon, and Sant'Anna 2021**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02637)). It is not at all obvious that forcing a scalar concept into a binary variable in order to be able to use these methods is a good idea: No estimator in the world can save you from wrong data.
