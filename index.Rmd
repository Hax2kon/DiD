# tldr; What to do?
Many of the contributions talk about and deal with the same problem(s), and the main problem is that TWFE _potentially_ assigns negative weights to some data points. In various ways, all solutions make the estimator more flexible in some way. This is usually at the expense of power, but could also tap into the bias-variance tradeoff. For applied researchers, there seems to be 2 contributions that will cover what you need:

**Diagnostics:** [**Goodman-Bacon 2018**](problems.html) offers solutions to identify whether there is a problem with negative weight in your TWFE model. Out-of-the-box code in `R` and `Stata`.

**Solution:** [**Imai, Kim and Wang 2021**](solutions.html) offers a flexible solution which also incorporates matching for time-series cross-sectional data to establish parallel trends (balance on observable confounders).


It remains a problem that the vast majority of articles only deal with binary treatment effects (but see [**Callaway, Goodmanâ€“Bacon, and Sant'Anna 2021**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02637)). It is not at all obvious that forcing a numerical concept into a binary variable in order to be able to use these methods is a good idea: No estimator in the world can save you from wrong data.
