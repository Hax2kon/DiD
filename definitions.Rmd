List of definitions used in the article:

**ART**: Average treatment effect of reversal among the reversed

**ATT**: Average Treatment effect on the Treated.

**L:** Lags, or the length of history over which treatment

**Parallel trends**: The assumption that in the absence of treatment, the difference between the treatment and control group is constant over time.

**Staggered adoption/staggered intervention:** The most common meaning of this is that treatment occurs at different points in time for different units in the data.
